# Academic website template

This repository contains the source code for Margarita Grinvald's public academic website: https://margaritagrinvald.com.

The page is responsive (meaning the design automatically adapts to different screen sizes, e.g. to look good on mobile) thanks to the use of the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework.

You are welcome to clone this code for your own personal use, but please attribute the source to my original website via a link on your page.

**Important:** if you use this template, please remember to remove my custom Google Analytics code section at the very beginning of the `index.html` file.
